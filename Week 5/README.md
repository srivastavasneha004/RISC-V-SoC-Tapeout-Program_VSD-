# üìã Week 5: OpenROAD Flow Setup - Floorplan & Placement

This document reproduces the Week 5 assignment for the OpenROAD flow setup and
execution of the Floorplan and Placement stages. Follow the steps below and
collect the requested artifacts (screenshots, logs, images) for submission.

## üåü What is OpenROAD?

**OpenROAD** is an open-source, fully automated **RTL-to-GDSII flow** for digital
IC design. It transforms your hardware description into actual silicon layout
through synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and
final layout generation.

‚ú® Why OpenROAD?
- Rapid design iterations
- Great for academic research
- Industry-relevant prototyping
- Completely open-source

## üìÇ Task Reference

Use this repository as a reference for installation and running the required
flow steps:

OpenROAD Reference ‚Äì https://github.com/spatha0011/spatha_vsdhdp/blob/main/Day14/README.md

## üéØ Objective

Set up the OpenROAD Flow Scripts environment and execute the Floorplan and
Placement stages only. Verify the floorplan and placement outputs and collect
evidence (logs, screenshots, images) as deliverables.

---

## üîß Task Components

1) Install OpenROAD Flow Scripts
- Clone and install OpenROAD Flow Scripts on a Linux system.
- Follow prerequisite installations listed in the reference repo.
- Verify setup by launching the OpenROAD environment (flow.tcl or equivalent).

2) Execute Floorplan and Placement (Only These Two Stages)
- Run the OpenROAD flow up to Floorplan and Placement. Stop before routing.
- Confirm core area and die dimensions are generated.
- Confirm standard cells are placed successfully.
- Review logs and intermediate files produced during these stages.

## üöÄ Installation & Execution Flow (example)

> The exact commands depend on your environment. The steps below are an
> example using the OpenROAD-flow-scripts repository.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run setup script

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build OpenROAD tools (example)

```bash
./build_openroad.sh --local
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify installation

```bash
source ./env.sh
yosys -h
openroad -h
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Floorplan + Placement

```bash
cd flow
make
```

What this runs:
- Floorplan stage: defines core area, die dimensions, I/O placement
- Placement stage: arranges standard cells to minimize delay & congestion
- STOP before routing (as required)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Visualize results

```bash
make gui_final
```

## üìä What We Accomplished

| Stage | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Installation | ‚úÖ Complete | Tools verified & operational |
| Floorplan | ‚úÖ Complete | Core area & die dimensions defined |
| Placement | ‚úÖ Complete | Standard cells optimally placed |
| Routing | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Done | Stopped as per requirements |

## üéì Key Learnings

### üîç What is Floorplanning?
- Defines chip boundaries and core area
- Places I/O pads and power rails
- Establishes placement blockages
- Impact: Determines overall design feasibility

### üîç What is Placement?
- Arranges standard cells within core area
- Optimizes for timing, area, and power
- Considers routing congestion
- Impact: Directly affects design performance

---

## üéâ Conclusion

Successfully installed **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** and completed **Floorplan +
Placement** stages. The design is now ready for Clock Tree Synthesis and
Routing in future weeks.
