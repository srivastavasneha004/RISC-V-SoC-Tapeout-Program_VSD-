# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!

This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

*"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."*
